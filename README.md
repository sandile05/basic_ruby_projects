# basic_ruby_projects
Basic ruby projects from The Odin Project

In this project i worked with character conversion from char to ord and back to char.

what i found challenging was figuring out the logic of finding out if the character is not a string
then it should be pushed to the final array and if its a number that is a - z then i can check the difference and apply the shift. that was a bit confusing
